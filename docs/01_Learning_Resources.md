# 📖 Overview

Before building the hardware, a comprehensive literature survey was conducted to understand the theoretical foundations of classical feedback control.

The project requires knowledge from multiple engineering disciplines including

- Control Systems
- Embedded Systems
- Sensors
- Electronics
- Mechanical Design
- Programming
- Mathematics

The objective of this section is to document every major resource that contributed to the design of this project.

# 🎯 Why Learn PID?

PID controllers are among the most widely used control algorithms ever developed.

More than **95% of industrial control loops** still employ some variation of PID because of their simplicity, reliability, and effectiveness.

Applications include

- ✈ Aircraft Stability
- 🚁 Drone Flight Controllers
- 🤖 Robotics
- 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles
- 🏭 Industrial Automation
- 🛰 Satellite Attitude Control
- ⚡ Power Electronics
- 🛠 CNC Machines

# 📌 Key Takeaways

> [!NOTE]
>
> Understanding **why** a PID controller works is far more important than memorizing the equations.

> [!TIP]
>
> Always begin tuning with **Kp**, then **Kd**, and finally **Ki**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Never tune all three gains simultaneously. This usually leads to unstable behaviour and makes debugging significantly harder.
